        <h2>I'm Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML file is
        structured. This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia on a webpage.
        HTML is a formal recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is generally adhered to by all major web
        browsers, including both desktop and mobile web browsers. HTML5 is the latest version of the specification.</p>
        <p>HTML is a text file containing specific syntax, file and naming conventions that show the computer and the web server
        that it is in HTML and should be read as such. By applying these HTML conventions to a text file in virtually any text
        editor, a user can write and design a basic webpage, and then upload it to the internet.</p>
