        <h2>I'm Learning HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a text-based approach to describing how content contained within an HTML
            file is
            structured. This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia on a
            webpage.
            HTML is a formal recommendation by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is generally adhered to by all
            major web
            browsers, including both desktop and mobile web browsers. HTML5 is the latest version of the specification.
        </p>
        <p>HTML is a text file containing specific syntax, file and naming conventions that show the computer and the
            web server
            that it is in HTML and should be read as such. By applying these HTML conventions to a text file in
            virtually any text
            editor, a user can write and design a basic webpage, and then upload it to the internet.</p>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the
            hood? This
            article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.
        </p>
        <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example, for changing the color and size of
            headings and
            links. It can be used to create a layout — for example, turning a single column of text into a layout with a
            main
            content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have
            a look at
            the links in this paragraph for specific examples.</p>
